### *An open-source CSS library for managing DOM Elements in a comprehensive grid system that's based on flexbox.*

Segments, Containers, Arrays, and Cells are the building blocks of Comet. They're a diverse set of tools that can be combined to create any layout. And along with an optional utility library, it'll vastly simplify the creation of large, and or small web projects.

Comet is built around a user-friendly syntax that's easy to remember and work with. It uses micro-classes to create human-readable code that's both fast and efficient. Comet was designed to be compliant with CSS methodologies by the likes of BEM and OOCSS.

#### Segment

Segments are the quintessential block class of Comet with a straightforward purpose. It's used to divide websites into sections.

    <section class="segment">
        <!--
            ...
        -->
    </section>

&nbsp;
#### Container

    <div class="container">
        <!--
            ...
        -->
    </div>

&nbsp;
#### Array

    <div class="array">
        <!--
            ...

    </div>

&nbsp;
